## File Naming

Enhanced reports use domain-based naming:
```
seo-audit-[domain]-[YYYY-MM-DD].pdf
```

Example:
```
seo-audit-getthrivin-com-2026-02-16.pdf
```

Basic reports use audit ID:
```
seo-audit-[audit-id].pdf
```

## Performance Considerations

Enhanced reports:
- Take slightly longer to generate (2-5 seconds vs 1-2 seconds)
- Produce larger files (500KB-2MB vs 200KB-500KB)
- Use more memory during generation

For high-volume scenarios, consider:
1. Generate reports asynchronously
2. Cache generated reports
3. Set up a report generation queue

## Testing

To test the enhanced report generator:

```bash
# Start audit
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/audit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"targetUrl": "https://example.com"}'

# Wait for completion, then generate enhanced report
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/report/[audit-id]/generate?format=pdf&enhanced=true"

# Download the report
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/report/[audit-id]/download?format=pdf&enhanced=true" \
  -o enhanced-report.pdf
```
