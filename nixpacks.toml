# Railway Nixpacks Configuration
# nixPkgs provides real Nix Chromium (tried first via 'which chromium').
# Puppeteer also downloads its own bundled Chrome during npm install as fallback.
# Do NOT set PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD here — that would block the fallback.

[phases.setup]
nixPkgs = ["chromium"]
